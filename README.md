# Khan Academy - Thunder Storm
<strong>Language: Javascript + Processing.js</strong></br>
Originally completed 6/27/2015

This was a fun one. <br>
Got to use a bunch of array functions like Push, Shift, Unshift, Pop, Map, and Some.

I also ended up learning a lot about variable scoping/hoisting, namespaces, and some general best practices.
